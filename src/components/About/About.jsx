        Hey everyone, I'm a web developer with a passion for turning ideas into
        a reality as (Websites, Web-Apps, Native-Apps). Meanwhile I study
        Computer Science and at the same time I taught myself different
        programming languages. <br></br><br/>
        As I integrated to this field I felt that Iâ€™m special, because solving
        real problems through Technologies had gave me an outstanding
        feelings in my life. Beside I have a passionate to learn more and more
        in the IT industry.

        everyone should give it a chance one time.
